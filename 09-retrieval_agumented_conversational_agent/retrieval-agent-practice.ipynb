Secondary liver cancer is when  other cancer types spread to the liver. For  example, cancer can start in the intestines  (colon) and spread to the liver. This is called  metastatic colon cancer in the liver. There is more than one type of primary liver  cancer in adults. The most common type is  hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The second most common type of primary  liver cancer in adults is called intrahepatic  cholangiocarcinoma, which is a cancer of the  bile ducts. Other primary liver cancers in adults  include rare types of sarcoma that start in the  blood vessel cells of the liver. Another rare type  is made of both hepatocellular carcinoma and  cholangiocarcinoma (this is called a mixed-type  tumor).

In stage 3b liver cancer, there is a single tumor  or multiple tumors of any size involving a major  branch of the portal vein or hepatic vein, or  tumor(s) that involve nearby organs (other than  the gallbladder) or the peritoneum (lining of the  abdomen).

Stage 4B liver cancer is cancer that has spread  to distant parts of the body (M1). The tumor can  be any size and there may be more than one  tumor in the liver. Cancer might be in the lymph  nodes.

Risk  factors can be activities that people do, things  in the environment, or traits passed from  parents to children through genes. Genes  are coded instructions for the proteins your  cells make. A mutation is when something  goes wrong in the genetic code. Mutations  can be passed down in families or can occur  spontaneously. In other words, they may be  present before you are born (inherited) or  caused by genetic damage (acquired) later in  life. For a list of risk factors, see Guide 2.  Risk is based on:  Those with cirrhosis  Those without cirrhosis Guide 2  Risk factors for liver cancer Those with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B should be enrolled in a liver cancer screening program Those without cirrhosis  • Hepatitis B • Hepatitis C • Alcohol • Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)  • Genetic hemochromatosis • Stage 4 primary biliary cholangitis • Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency • Other causes of cirrhosis Those without cirrhosis • Hepatitis B • Additional risk factors include HBV carrier with family history of liver cancer, Asian males 40 years  of age or over, Asian females 50 years of age or over, and African/North American Blacks with  hepatitis B\n",

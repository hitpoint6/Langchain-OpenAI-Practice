"7 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20211 Liver cancer basics  The liver The liver is a large organ located on  the right side of the body under your  rib cage. The liver, gallbladder, and bile  ducts work together to make, store, and  secrete bile. Bile is a fluid that helps  digest fat in the food you eat. The liver  also filters your blood and makes other  important substances called factors that  help your body function normally. This  chapter will discuss the liver and give an  overview of liver cancer. The liver The liver is a large organ located on the right  side of the body under your rib cage. Inside  the liver is a network of blood and lymph  vessels. The liver filters blood, helps with blood  clotting, makes bile, breaks down fats, and  helps process sugar for energy. The liver also  produces lymph. Lymph gives cells water and  food and contains white blood cells that fight  germs.  The liver has two lobes, a right and left lobe.  Blood enters the liver from the hepatic artery  and the portal vein. Blood leaves the liver  through the hepatic veins before entering the  inferior vena cava and returning to the heart.  SpleenLiver Stomach PancreasJejunumDuodenumRight Lobe of Liver Left Lobe of Liver Gallbladder Common bile ductThe liver and  nearby organs The gallbladder,  stomach, pancreas,  spleen, and small  intestine are found  near the liver."
"8 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20211 Liver cancer basics  The liver Bile Liver cells make bile. Bile is a yellow or green  fluid made up of cholesterol, bilirubin, salts such  as potassium and sodium, water, and other  elements found in the body. It flows into small  channels that drain into thin tubes called ducts.  These ducts form larger and larger channels  that flow into the left and right hepatic ducts.  The left and right hepatic ducts join to form the  common hepatic duct. The common hepatic  duct joins with the cystic duct that connects  to the gallbladder to form the common bile  duct. The common bile duct is joined by the  pancreatic duct just before it enters the small  intestine.The gallbladder The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ  found under the liver. It is sometimes described  as sac-like because it holds bile from the liver.  Bile is stored in the gallbladder, and when you  eat, it then passes through the bile ducts into  the small bowel (intestine) to help digest food.  The hepatobiliary system  The liver is part of the hepatobiliary system.  “Hepato” means liver and biliary refers to the  gallbladder and bile ducts. Together, they form  the hepatobiliary system. The hepatobiliary  system makes bile and is a part of the digestive  system. The digestive system takes in food,  breaks it down (digestion), absorbs nutrients,  and removes waste from the body. Some  doctors consider the pancreas to be a part of  this system."

"9 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20211 Liver cancer basics  Liver cancer  1 Liver cancer basics  Liver cancer | How liver cancer spreads Liver cancer Cancer that starts in the liver is called primary  liver cancer. Secondary liver cancer is when  other cancer types spread to the liver. For  example, cancer can start in the intestines  (colon) and spread to the liver. This is called  metastatic colon cancer in the liver. There is more than one type of primary liver  cancer in adults. The most common type is  hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There is a  subtype of HCC called FLHC (fibrolamellar  hepatocellular carcinoma). FLHC affects very  few people and usually occurs at a younger  age.  The second most common type of primary  liver cancer in adults is called intrahepatic  cholangiocarcinoma, which is a cancer of the  bile ducts. Other primary liver cancers in adults  include rare types of sarcoma that start in the  blood vessel cells of the liver. Another rare type  is made of both hepatocellular carcinoma and  cholangiocarcinoma (this is called a mixed-type  tumor).   Information on bile  duct and gallbladder  tumors can be found in  NCCN Guidelines for  Patients: Gallbladder  and Bile Duct Cancers ,  available at NCCN.org/ patientguidelines . Information on  sarcomas in the liver  can be found in NCCN  Guidelines for Patients:  Soft Tissue Sarcoma ,  available at NCCN.org/ patientguidelines ."
"sarcomas in the liver  can be found in NCCN  Guidelines for Patients:  Soft Tissue Sarcoma ,  available at NCCN.org/ patientguidelines .   This patient guideline will focus on HCC and its  treatment.  How liver cancer spreads Liver cancer can spread in many ways. It can  spread directly through the liver. It can also  spread to an area far from the primary tumor  called a distant metastasis. Liver cancer most  often metastasizes to the lung or bone. This is  called metastatic liver cancer. Inside the liver are blood and lymphatic  vessels. Cancer can spread from the liver  through the blood and lymphatic system. The  lymphatic system is made up of a network of  vessels that carry a clear fluid called lymph.  Lymph gives cells water and food, and has  white blood cells that fight germs. Lymph nodes  filter lymph and remove the germs. Although  possible, HCC does not commonly spread to  nearby lymph nodes."
"10 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20211 Liver cancer basics  Cancer stages   Cancer stages   A cancer stage is a way to describe the  extent of the cancer at the time you are first  diagnosed. The American Joint Committee on  Cancer (AJCC) created a staging system to  determine how much cancer is in your body,  where it is located, and what subtype you  have. AJCC is just one type of staging system.  Staging is needed to make treatment decisions.  Once treatment starts, staging does not  change.  TNM scores The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system  is sometimes used to stage liver cancer. In  this system, the letters T, N, and M describe  different areas of cancer growth. Based on  surgery and lab results, your doctor will assign a score or number to each letter. The higher  the number, the larger the tumor or the more  the cancer has spread. These scores will be  combined to assign the cancer a stage. A TNM  example might look like this: T1N0M0 or T1,  N0, M0.   T (tumor) - Size of the main (primary)  tumor   N (node) - If cancer has spread to nearby  (regional) lymph nodes   M (metastasis) -  If cancer has spread to  distant parts of the body or metastasized Keep in mind, TNM scores are not always used  to describe liver cancer. Doctors may explain  your cancer stage in different ways to make it  less confusing.  Human liver anatomy Liver cancer can invade"
"Keep in mind, TNM scores are not always used  to describe liver cancer. Doctors may explain  your cancer stage in different ways to make it  less confusing.  Human liver anatomy Liver cancer can invade  nearby veins, arteries, and  bile ducts. It can spread to the  gallbladder and other parts of  the body."
"11 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20211 Liver cancer basics  Cancer stages   T = Tumor  The primary tumor size is measured in  centimeters (cm). A large pea is 1 cm. A golf  ball is 4 cm.   T1 One tumor 2 cm or smaller, or one  tumor larger than 2 cm that has not  invaded blood vessels (without vascular  invasion) • T1a One tumor 2 cm or smaller • T1b One tumor larger than 2 cm, but  blood vessels do not have cancer  T2 One tumor larger than 2 cm with  vascular invasion, or multiple tumors, no  tumors are larger than 5 cm  T3 Multiple tumors with at least one that is  larger than 5 cm  T4 Single tumor or multiple tumors of  any size involving a major branch of the  portal vein or hepatic vein, or tumor(s)  that involve nearby organs (other than  the gallbladder) or have invaded the  peritoneum (lining of the abdomen) N = Node There are hundreds of lymph nodes throughout  your body. They work as filters to help fight  infection and remove harmful things from  your body. Regional lymph nodes are those  located near the liver. These include the hilar,  hepatoduodenal ligament, inferior phrenic,  inferior vena cava lymph nodes, and the hepatic  artery and portal vein lymph nodes. Cancer in  the lymph nodes is uncommon.  N0 means no cancer is in regional lymph  nodes    N1 means cancer in the regional lymph"

Common sites for  metastasis include the lung and bone.  M0 means no distant metastasis is found  M1 means distant metastasis is found G = Grade Another factor used in staging is the cancer  grade. Grade describes how abnormal the  tumor cells look under a microscope (called  histology). Higher-grade cancers tend to  grow and spread faster than lower-grade  cancers. GX means the grade can’t be  determined, followed by G1, G2, G3, and G4.  G4 is the highest grade for liver cancer. Well  differentiated means the cancer cells look  similar to normal cells. Poorly differentiated  means the cancer cells look very different  compared to normal cells. Undifferentiated  means the cells are abnormal and don’t look  like the cells in the organ where cancer started.   GX Grade cannot be determined  G1 Well differentiated   G2 Moderately differentiated   G3 Poorly differentiated   G4 Undifferentiated"
"12 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20211 Liver cancer basics  Cancer stages   Numbered stages Number stages range from stage 1 to stage 4,  with 4 being the most advanced. Doctors write  these stages as stage I, stage II, stage III, and  stage IV. A stage consists of a TNM score.  See  Guide 1.Stage 1 In stage 1 liver cancer, there is only one tumor  up to 2 cm in size or a tumor larger than 2 cm  that does not involve blood vessels found in  the liver. It may have grown into veins, arteries,  or bile ducts. Cancer has not spread to lymph  nodes (N0) or other parts of the body (M0). Stage 2 In stage 2 liver cancer, there is one tumor larger  than 2 cm that has grown into veins, arteries, or  bile ducts. There might be multiple tumors that  are smaller than 5 cm.

"14 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20211 Liver cancer basics  Risk factors  Risk factors  A risk factor is anything that increases your  chances of having a disease like cancer. Risk  factors can be activities that people do, things  in the environment, or traits passed from  parents to children through genes. Genes  are coded instructions for the proteins your  cells make. A mutation is when something  goes wrong in the genetic code. Mutations  can be passed down in families or can occur  spontaneously. In other words, they may be  present before you are born (inherited) or  caused by genetic damage (acquired) later in  life. For a list of risk factors, see Guide 2.  Risk is based on:  Those with cirrhosis  Those without cirrhosis Guide 2  Risk factors for liver cancer Those with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B should be enrolled in a liver cancer screening program Those without cirrhosis  • Hepatitis B • Hepatitis C • Alcohol • Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)  • Genetic hemochromatosis • Stage 4 primary biliary cholangitis • Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency • Other causes of cirrhosis Those without cirrhosis • Hepatitis B • Additional risk factors include HBV carrier with family history of liver cancer, Asian males 40 years  of age or over, Asian females 50 years of age or over, and African/North American Blacks with  hepatitis B"
"15 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20211 Liver cancer basics  Risk factors  Cirrhosis Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver. It is a type of  long-term (chronic) liver disease where liver  cells are replaced by scar tissue. If you have  cirrhosis, you should be screened for liver  cancer. Cirrhosis can be caused by:  Hepatitis B  Hepatitis C  Alcohol  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)  Genetic hemochromatosis  Stage 4 primary biliary cholangitis  Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency  Other causes of cirrhosisHepatitis Hepatitis is a type of liver disease.

"16 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20211 Liver cancer basics  Screening   1 Liver cancer basics  Screening  | Key points Screening  Those at risk for liver cancer may have  screening tests done on a regular basis to  find cancer early. Two tests are recommended  every 6 months for those at risk of developing  liver cancer. They include:  An ultrasound (US)   An alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test  An ultrasound is a test that uses sound waves  to take pictures of the inside of the body.  A blood test checks for the protein AFP. An  elevated or rising AFP might be a sign of  primary liver cancer. This is cancer that starts in  the liver.  Follow-up steps after a screening ultrasound  may include:  If AFP is elevated or an ultrasound finds  nodules that are 10 millimeters (mm) or  larger, then you will have more tests.  If ultrasound finds nodules that are smaller  than 10 mm, repeat ultrasound and AFP in  3 to 6 months.  If the ultrasound is negative, repeat  ultrasound and AFP in 6 months.Key points  The liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts are  part of the hepatobiliary system.  A risk factor is anything that increases your  chances of having a disease like cancer.  Screening is when tests are done on  a regular basis to detect a disease in  someone without symptoms.

Medical history A medical history is a record of all health  issues and treatments you have had in your  life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury  and when it happened. Bring a list of old and  new medicines and any over-the-counter  medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.  Tell your doctor about any symptoms you have.  A medical history will help determine which  treatment is best for you. Family history Some cancers and other diseases can run  in families. Your doctor will ask about the  health history of family members who are  blood relatives. It is important to ask members  from both parents’ side of the family about  all cancers, not just liver cancer. Ask about  other health issues like heart disease and  diabetes, at what age they were diagnosed,  and if anyone died from their cancer.

"20 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20212 Diagnosing liver cancer  Blood tests  Physical exam  During a physical exam, your health care  provider may:  Check your temperature, blood pressure,  pulse, and breathing rate  Check your weight  Listen to your lungs and heart  Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat  Feel and apply pressure to parts of your  body to see if organs are of normal size,  are soft or hard, or cause pain when  touched. Tell your doctor if you feel pain.  Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your  neck, underarm, and groin. Tell the doctor  if you have felt any lumps or have any  pain.  Doctors should perform a thorough physical  exam along with a complete health history.  Blood tests  Blood tests check for signs of disease and how  well organs are working. They require a sample  of your blood, which is removed through a  needle placed into your vein.  Complete blood count A complete blood count (CBC) measures the  levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and  platelets in your blood. Your doctor will want  to know if you have enough red blood cells to  carry oxygen throughout your body, white blood  cells to fight infection, and platelets to control  bleeding.Comprehensive metabolic panel  A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) is  a test that measures 14 different substances  in your blood.

A high level of BUN can be a sign  your kidneys aren’t working well.  Creatinine is a waste product produced in  the muscles. It is filtered out of the blood  by the kidneys and tells how well the  kidneys are working. Liver function panel   Liver function tests (LFTs) look at the health  of your liver by measuring chemicals that are  made or processed by the liver. Levels that  are too high or low signal that the liver is not  working well or the bile ducts might be blocked.  One of the LFTs measured is bilirubin, a  chemical that gives bile its color. There may  be too much bilirubin in the blood if a tumor  is blocking a bile duct and preventing the free  flow of bile from the liver into the intestines or  the liver is not working as well as it should. Too  much bilirubin causes a yellowing of the eyes  and skin called jaundice. It might cause itchy  skin and dark-colored urine. Tests to measure the following might be done:  Albumin  Transaminases such as aspartate  aminotransferase (AST) and alanine  transaminase (ALT)  Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)"

Viruses  called hepatitis A, hepatitis B (HBV), and  hepatitis C (HCV) are the most common types  of hepatitis. A hepatitis panel is a blood test that  checks to see if you have a hepatitis infection  caused by one of these viruses. Chronic (long- term) hepatitis B and a current or past infection  with hepatitis C increase the risk for liver cancer  and biliary tract cancers. Hepatitis causes the  liver to become inflamed and not work as it  should. HBV can cause scarring of the liver,  liver failure, and cancer. A hepatitis panel will tell your treatment team  if you had hepatitis in the past or if you have it  today. You may be referred to a hepatologist if  you test positive. A hepatologist is a doctor who  specializes in the care of the liver, biliary tract,  gallbladder, and pancreas.  Fibrosis score Fibrosis is mild scarring of liver tissue.

"22 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20212 Diagnosing liver cancer  Imaging tests Imaging tests Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your  body. These tests are used to find and treat  liver cancer. Imaging tests show the primary  tumor, or where the cancer started, and look for  cancer in other parts of the body. Imaging tests  also look to see if the tumor involves any veins,  arteries, or organs. A radiologist, an expert who looks at test  images, will write a report and send this report  to your doctor. Your doctor will discuss the  results with you. Feel free to ask as many  questions as you like.  CT scan A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan  uses x-rays and computer technology to take  pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many  x-rays of the same body part from different  angles. All the images are combined to make  one detailed three-dimensional (3D) picture.  A CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and/ or pelvis may be one of the tests to look for  cancer. In most cases, contrast will be used.  Contrast material is used to improve the  pictures of the inside of the body.

You might be given medicines, such  as Benadryl® and prednisone, to avoid the  effects of those allergies. Contrast might not be used if you have a serious allergy or if your  kidneys aren’t working well. Dynamic CT scan In a dynamic CT scan, there are two scans: one  without contrast and one with contrast. First, a  scan is done without contrast. Then, contrast is  injected into a vein and another scan is done.  Multiphasic CT scan  A multiphasic CT scan is similar to a dynamic  CT scan. It starts without contrast. Then  contrast is added and multiple sets of pictures  are taken as the contrast moves through the  arteries and veins of the liver. This allows  doctors to see where the tumor is in the liver  and if the tumor involves any veins, arteries, or  organs.  MRI scan A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take  pictures of the inside of the body. It does not  use x-rays. Contrast might be used.

A magnetic resonance  cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a type of  MRI scan that makes very clear pictures of the  pancreas and bile ducts. No contrast is used  because bile and other fluids act as their own  contrast. An MRCP is usually done with an MRI  scan.

A probe will be pressed onto your abdomen.  Ultrasound is good at showing small areas of  cancer that are near the surface of the body.  Sometimes, an ultrasound or MRI is used to  guide a biopsy. A contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) might  be used in addition to other tests to learn more  about nodules or very small tumors.PTC  A percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography  (PTC) uses contrast and an x-ray to take  pictures of the biliary tract. A needle or small  catheter (thin, flexible tube) is placed through  the skin (percutaneous) into a bile duct and  contrast is injected. X-rays that use small  amounts of radiation are then taken to make  pictures of the bile ducts. If necessary, a  catheter can be inserted to drain fluid from the  biliary tract into a bag outside of the body or  into the small intestine. A metal stent may also  be placed for an obstruction or blocked bile  duct.  For this test, you will be given medicine to help  you feel relaxed.

"24 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20212 Diagnosing liver cancer  Biopsy Biopsy A biopsy is a procedure that removes  samples of fluid or tissue. Tissue or fluid may  be removed from your body and tested to  diagnose cancer. If you are at high risk for liver  cancer, sometimes findings on CT or MRI are  enough to make the diagnosis and a biopsy  may not be needed.  A biopsy may be considered because you  are not at high risk (no cirrhosis, no HBV) or  imaging results are unclear. You may have a  biopsy if the cancer has spread to another area  in the body, also known as metastatic cancer.  Your doctor may want to assess the cell type of  the cancer before starting treatment.  Types of possible biopsies include:  Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) uses a thin  needle to remove a sample of tissue or  fluid. An ultrasound (US) may guide the  FNA biopsy.   Core needle biopsy removes tissue  samples with a hollow needle about the  same size as a needle used for an IV  (intravenous) line.   Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive  surgery that uses a camera through a  small cut in the abdomen.

This chapter describes  treatment options and what to expect.  Not everyone will receive the same  treatment. Discuss with your doctor  which treatment might be best for you.  Liver cancer is treatable. Treatment can be  local, systemic, or a combination of both. It  is important to have regular talks with your  doctor about your goals for treatment and your  treatment plan. If possible, seek treatment at  a hospital or cancer center that specializes in  liver cancer. There are 2 types of treatment:  Local therapy focuses treatment on a  certain area. It includes surgery, ablation,  embolization, and radiation therapy.   Systemic therapy works throughout the  body. It includes chemotherapy, targeted  therapy, and immunotherapy.  There are many treatment options. However,  not everyone responds to treatment in the  same way. Some people will do better than  expected. Others will do worse. Many factors  play in a role in how you respond to treatment. Treatment team Treating cancer takes a team approach. Some  members of your care team will be with you  throughout cancer treatment, while others will  only be there for parts of it. Get to know your  care team and let them get to know you.

"for each member of your team. This will make  it easier for you and anyone involved in your  care to know whom to contact with questions or  concerns. Surgery Surgery is a form of local treatment. It is an  operation or procedure to remove cancer from  the body. This is only one part of a treatment  plan.  Surgery can be used to:   Remove all of the tumor   Provide supportive care (relieve pain or  discomfort or extend life)  Liver surgery is not an option for most people  with liver cancer. Cancer is often found in  multiple places throughout the liver, and  removing tumors might not leave enough  healthy liver tissue for your liver to function  properly. Surgery may not be an option if the  cancer has spread, the liver is not healthy  enough for surgery, or if other medical  conditions exist.  The type of surgery you receive depends on  size, location, and number of tumors in the  liver. It also depends on if there is cancer in  any surrounding organs and tissues, if there is  cirrhosis, and how severe the cirrhosis is.  When preparing for surgery, you should seek  the opinion of an experienced surgeon. The  surgeon should be an expert in performing  these types of surgery. Seek care or ask for a  referral to a hospital or cancer center that has  experience in treating liver cancer."
"29 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20213 Treatment overview  Surgery Tumor resection Imaging tests will be used to see if your cancer  is resectable (can be removed completely with  surgery) or unresectable (cannot be removed  with surgery). The goal of surgery or tumor  resection is to remove all of the cancer. To  do so, the tumor is removed along with some  normal-looking tissue around its edge. The  normal-looking tissue is called the surgical  margin. A clear or negative margin (R0) is  when no cancerous cells are found in the  tissue around the edge of the tumor. In an R1  positive margin, the surgeon removes all of the  visible tumor, but the microscopic margins are  still positive for tumor cells. In an R2 positive  margin, the surgeon does not or is unable to  remove all of the visible tumor. A negative margin (R0) is the best result. Your  surgeon will look carefully for cancer not only  along the surgical margin, but in other nearby  areas. It is not always possible to find all of  the cancer. Sometimes, surgeons can’t safely  remove the tumor with a cancer-free margin.  You might have more than one surgery. You  might also have a wound drain to prevent fluid  from collecting in the body after surgery.Partial hepatectomy  If the tumor is resectable, then you might  have a partial hepatectomy. This is surgery  to remove a portion of the liver. It might be a  small wedge resection or removal of an entire  lobe. The part of the liver that remains will keep  working, and the missing section will regrow."
"to remove a portion of the liver. It might be a  small wedge resection or removal of an entire  lobe. The part of the liver that remains will keep  working, and the missing section will regrow.  A partial hepatectomy is different than a liver  transplant.  A partial hepatectomy is not for everyone. Liver  damage, such as cirrhosis or fibrosis, can make  surgery more difficult or not possible. The size  and location of the tumor, as well as your liver  function (Child-Pugh score), will play a role in if  tumor resection is the best option for you. You  must also have a working liver and be healthy  enough for surgery.  Get to know your  care team and let  them get to   know you."
"30 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20213 Treatment overview  Liver transplant Liver transplant In a liver transplant, the entire diseased liver  is removed and replaced with a healthy donor  liver. The new liver may be donated from a  person who recently died or a section of liver  may be donated from a living person. A liver  transplant is based on certain size limits and  tumor locations.  The liver is divided into 8 sections or segments  based on portal vein and bile duct locations.  It is possible for someone to donate a portion  of the liver. Structures such as the inferior  vena cava, portal vein, hepatic artery, and  bile ducts are reconnected to the new liver.  Remember, a liver transplant can be a whole  liver replacement or just a portion.  A liver transplant may be an option for  people who can’t have a partial hepatectomy. However, not everyone is a candidate for a liver  transplant.  Other treatments may be given if you are  waiting for a transplant. These treatments are  called bridging therapy and include ablation and  embolization.  There is still a chance that cancer will return  after a liver transplant. It is also possible your  body will reject the donor liver. You will be given  medicine to prevent rejection.  Bridge therapy There can be long wait times to receive a liver  transplant.

Treatments include ablation and  embolization. UNOS United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)  is the non-profit organization that manages  the organ transplant list in the United  States. Those with hepatocellular carcinoma  (HCC) must meet certain criteria to be  eligible for a liver transplant.

of the order of treatments and what they do.  • Neoadjuvant (before) treatment is given to  shrink the tumor before primary treatment  (surgery).  • Primary treatment is the main treatment  given to rid the body of cancer. Surgery is  usually the main treatment for resectable liver  cancer. This is not an option for everyone.  • Adjuvant (after) treatment  is given after  primary treatment to rid the body of any  cancer cells left behind from surgery. It is  also used when the risk of cancer returning  (recurrence) is felt to be high.  • First-line treatment is the first set of  treatments given. • Second-line treatment is the next set of  treatments given after the first treatment has  failed.  Talk to your doctor about your treatment plan and  what it means for your stage of liver cancer.
"32 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20213 Treatment overview  Ablation  3 Treatment overview  Ablation | Arterially directed therapy Ablation Ablation is a type of local treatment that uses  extreme cold or heat, radio waves, microwaves,  or chemicals such as ethanol (a type of alcohol)  or acetic acid to destroy cancer cells. It can  destroy small tumors with little harm to nearby  tissue. Types of ablation used to destroy cancer cells:  Chemical includes percutaneous ethanol  injection (PEI) or acetic acid injection.  Thermal includes radiofrequency ablation  (RFA) or microwave ablation (MWA).  RFA kills cancer cells by heating them  with high-energy radio waves. MWA uses  microwaves.  Cryoablation kills cancer cells by freezing  them with a very cold substance. All types of ablation use a special needle,  called a probe, which is inserted into the tumor.  With cryotherapy, a medical gas is passed  through the probe to cause below-freezing  temperatures. This freezes the tumor to destroy  it. With RFA, the probe emits radio waves to  heat the tumor and destroy it. The probe can be  guided into place with a CT scan, ultrasound, or  other imaging tests. The probe will be removed  when treatment is done.  Your doctor will check the tumor size and  location, and how well your liver is working  before doing this treatment. Ablation can be  done through the skin (percutaneous), through  small cuts (laparoscopic), or using a large"
"location, and how well your liver is working  before doing this treatment. Ablation can be  done through the skin (percutaneous), through  small cuts (laparoscopic), or using a large  incision like in surgery (open approach). RFA  and MWA are the most common types of  ablation  used. Ablation is often used with smaller tumors of                                                       3 cm or less. Tumors must be in an area that  can be reached with ablation and not be near  other organs, major blood vessels, or bile  ducts.  Arterially directed therapy Arterially directed therapy includes embolization  (TAE), chemoembolization (TACE), drug- eluting bead embolization (DEB-TACE), and  radioembolization (Y-90 or TARE). It treats  tumors by injecting particles, chemotherapy,  or radioactive beads directly into the blood  vessels that supply the tumor(s). A small  catheter is inserted into the artery and is guided  to the tumor. Once in place, the particles,  chemotherapy, or beads are injected. The common types of arterially directed therapy  include:   Transarterial embolization (TAE) involves  blocking the blood supply to the tumor  by injecting tiny particles into the blood  vessels feeding the tumor(s). Stopping the  blood flow cuts off the oxygen supply to  the tumor and causes cancer cells to die.  TAE has risks. It might not be used if your  bilirubin level is above 3 mg/mL.  Chemoembolization (also known as  TACE or transarterial chemoembolization)"

"33 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20213 Treatment overview  Arterially directed therapy  DEB-TACE (drug-eluting bead transarterial  chemoembolization) uses tiny particles  loaded with chemotherapy that are  injected into the blood vessels feeding  the tumor(s). The particles give off small  amounts of chemotherapy to the tumor  over several days. It might not be used if  your bilirubin level is above 3 mg/mL.  Transarterial radioembolization (TARE)  uses tiny glass or resin beads filled with  the radioactive isotope yttrium-90 that  are injected directly into the tumor(s).  TARE has risks. It might not be used if  your bilirubin level is above 3 mg/mL. This  procedure is often referred to as Y-90.Depending on the circumstances, arterially  directed therapy may be used as bridging  treatment before a liver transplant, as definitive  treatment, or for palliation. Definitive treatment  is defined as the best treatment after all choices  have been considered. The type of arterially  directed therapy recommended will depend  on the size, number, and location of tumors as  well as your previous medical history and the  expertise of your treating physicians.

"34 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20213 Treatment overview  Radiation therapy Radiation therapy Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy  radiation from x-rays, gamma rays, protons,  and other sources to kill cancer cells and shrink  tumors. It is given over a certain period of days  to weeks. RT can be given alone, before or  after surgery, or with other therapies to treat  or slow the growth of cancer. Sometimes,  radiation is given with certain systemic  therapies such as chemotherapy. It may be  used as supportive care to help ease pain or  discomfort caused by cancer. RT may be a  treatment for all tumors, regardless of location.  In general, radiation may be given:  As the primary (first) treatment   Before surgery, called neoadjuvant  therapy, to shrink the tumor before surgery   During surgery, called intraoperative  radiation therapy (IORT)  After surgery, called adjuvant treatment, to  kill any cancerous cells that remainExternal beam radiation therapy  External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses a  machine outside of the body to aim radiation at  the tumor(s).  Types of EBRT that may be used to treat your  cancer include:  Stereotactic body radiation therapy  (SBRT) uses high-energy radiation beams  to treat cancers. The goal is to kill or  ablate the tumor. SBRT can be done with  either photons or protons.  Proton beam radiation therapy  uses  particles called protons to treat and kill  tumor cells. Protons reduce the dose of  radiation to surrounding normal tissues."
"either photons or protons.  Proton beam radiation therapy  uses  particles called protons to treat and kill  tumor cells. Protons reduce the dose of  radiation to surrounding normal tissues.  Three-dimensional conformal radiation  therapy (3D-CRT) uses computer  software and CT images to aim beams  that match the shape of the tumor.  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy  (IMRT) uses small beams of different  strengths so that the radiation matches the  shape of the tumor. This limits the amount  of radiation to normal tissues.  Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT)  uses a computer to create a picture of the  tumor. This helps guide the radiation beam  during treatment. It is used with IMRT and  3D-CRT. Tumors can shift slightly within  the body and can change shape and  size between and during treatment visits.  Because of this, IGRT can improve how  well 3D-CRT and IMRT target the tumor.   Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT)  uses radiation treatment aimed directly at  the tumor during surgery.  Palliative EBRT is used to treat pain  caused by cancer."
"35 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20213 Treatment overview  Systemic therapy  Systemic therapy  Systemic therapy works throughout the body.  Types include chemotherapy, targeted therapy,  and immunotherapy. Systemic therapy might  be used alone or with other therapies. Goals of  systemic therapy should be discussed before  starting treatment. Your wishes about treatment  are important. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells  throughout the body, including cancer cells  and normal cells. All chemotherapies affect  the instructions (genes) that tell cancer cells  how and when to grow and divide. FOLFOX  (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) is a  type of combination chemotherapy that might  be used in some cases to treat liver cancer.  Targeted therapy  Targeted therapy focuses on specific or unique  features of cancer cells. Targeted therapies  seek out how cancer cells grow, divide, and  move in the body. These drugs stop the action  of molecules that help cancer cells grow and/ or survive. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is a  type of targeted therapy that blocks the signals  that cause liver cancer to grow and spread.

In a tumor with an NTRK gene fusion, a  piece of the NTRK gene and a piece of another  gene fuse, or join. This activates the NTRK  gene in a way that causes uncontrolled cell  growth. Larotrectinib (Vitrakvi®) and entrectinib  (Rozlytrek™) might be used to target advanced  or metastatic cancer that is NTRK gene fusion- positive. Did you know? The terms “chemotherapy” and  “systemic therapy” are often used  interchangeably, but they are not  the same. Chemotherapy, targeted  therapy, and immunotherapy are all  types of systemic therapy."
"36 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20213 Treatment overview  Clinical trials Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a targeted therapy that  increases the activity of your immune system.  By doing so, it improves your body’s ability to  find and destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapy  can be given alone or with other types of  treatment.  The following are types of targeted  immunotherapies that might be used to treat  liver cancer:  Atezolizumab (Tecentriq®)  Ipilimumab (Yervoy®)  Nivolumab (Opdivo®)   Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) For more information,  read the NCCN  Guidelines  for Patients:  Immunotherapy Side  Effects, available  at NCCN.org/ patientguidelines.Clinical trials A clinical trial is a type of medical research  study.

The rules may be about  age, cancer type and stage, treatment history,  or general health. These rules ensure that  participants are alike in specific ways and that  the treatment is as safe as possible.  Informed consent Clinical trials are managed by a group of  experts called a research team. The research  team will review the study with you in detail,  including its purpose and the risks and benefits  of joining. This information is also described  in detail in an informed consent form. Giving  informed consent means that you understand  the possible benefits and risks and agree to  join. Read the form carefully and ask questions  before signing it.

"38 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20213 Treatment overview  Supportive care Supportive care Supportive care (also called palliative care) is  health care that relieves symptoms caused by  cancer or its treatment and improves quality  of life. It might include pain relief (palliative  care), emotional or spiritual support, financial  aid, or family counseling. Supportive care is  given during all cancer stages. Tell your care  team how you are feeling and about any side  effects. Best supportive care is used with  other treatments to improve quality of life. Best  supportive care, supportive care, and palliative  care are often used interchangeably. Treatment side effects All cancer treatments can cause unwanted  health issues. Such health issues are called  side effects. Side effects depend on many  factors. These factors include the drug type  and dose, length of treatment, and the person.  Some side effects may be harmful to your  health. Others may just be unpleasant. Ask for a complete list of side effects of your  treatments. Also, tell your treatment team about  any new or worsening symptoms. There may  be ways to help you feel better. There are also  ways to prevent some side effects. Trouble eating Sometimes side effects from surgery, cancer,  or other treatments might cause you to feel not  hungry or sick to your stomach (nauseated).  You might have a sore mouth. Healthy eating is  important during treatment. It includes eating a  balanced diet, eating the right amount of food,  and drinking enough fluids.

"39 NCCN Guidelines for Patients®  Liver Cancer, 20213 Treatment overview  Supportive care Blocked bile duct  A tumor in the liver may grow large enough to  block your bile duct. A bile duct is a small tube  that drains digestive fluid (bile) from the liver.  The common bile duct carries bile from the liver  through the pancreas and into the first part of  the small intestine (duodenum). A blocked duct  causes bile to build up in the liver. As a result,  you may have pain, itching, discomfort, and/ or yellowing of the skin and eyes. This is called  jaundice. This blockage can cause an infection  of the bile duct called cholangitis. A blocked bile duct may be treated by placing a  biliary stent or doing a biliary bypass. A biliary  stent is a tiny tube that is placed in the bile duct  to unblock it or keep it open. Before the stent  can be placed, bile may need to be drained  through an opening in the side of the body.  You may need a new or second stent during  or after cancer treatment if the tumor grows. A  biliary bypass is a surgery to re-route the flow  of bile from the common bile duct into the small  intestine. The result is that the bile flow avoids  (bypasses) the blocked part of the duct. Blocked bile duct A tumor in the liver may  block your bile duct. A stent  is a tiny tube that is placed  in the bile duct to unblock it  or keep it open."

Types of surgery:  Resection removes a tumor. Sometimes,  a partial hepatectomy is referred to as  resection. A partial hepatectomy removes  part of the liver.  A transplant removes all of your liver and  replaces it with a donor liver.

This  choice starts with having an open and  honest conversation with your doctor.  It’s your choice  In shared decision-making, you and your  doctors share information, discuss the options,  and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an  open and honest conversation between you  and your doctor.  Treatment decisions are very personal. What  is important to you may not be important to  someone else.  Some things that may play a role in your  decision-making:  What you want and how that might differ  from what others want  Your religious and spiritual beliefs  Your feelings about certain treatments like  surgery or chemotherapy  Your feelings about pain or side effects  such as nausea and vomiting  Cost of treatment, travel to treatment  centers, and time away from work  Quality of life and length of life  How active you are and the activities that  are important to you Think about what you want from treatment.

While cancer can’t be ignored,  there is time to have another doctor review your  test results and suggest a treatment plan. This  is called getting a second opinion, and it’s a  normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get  second opinions!  Things you can do to prepare:   Check with your insurance company about  its rules on second opinions. There may  be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors who  are not part of your insurance plan.  Make plans to have copies of all your  records sent to the doctor you will see for  your second opinion.
